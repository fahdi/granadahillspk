    <h1>Chairman’s Message</h1>
    <h5>People are asking me why I am so driven to leave a dream California lifestyle and come to Pakistan to raise a housing project. I believe in making a positive contribution to society, and to the lives of the people and the country I love and deeply care about.</h5>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row ">
  <div class="medium-10 columns">
    <p class="message-text"> I have held on to a dream, a dream of showing the people of Pakistan something different and by extension, making a difference in their lives. I know that I cannot single-handedly change the politics or the economy in Pakistan, however, I do believe that I can substantially improve the quality of life of many of its people and bring them at par with the standard of living found in my adapted home of California.
      <q class="pull-quote">"Granada Hills, I believe, is not just a housing development project, it is an entire lifestyle. "</q>
      We are going to develop a world-class community that offers first world infrastructure with all the amenities that come with living in the developed world. Our successes in Rawalpindi will be a fulfillment of a vision that macro-level change can take time but a micro-level change at a community level can have a significant impact on the lives of thousands of families at a time. I aim to bring my 30 years of experience as a master developer in California to design and deliver transformative and unprecedented lifestyle change to community residents. We plan on becoming an integral part of the city where the residents cannot imagine a better living and lifestyle. We bring the American dream to you to live it in Pakistan. Through our initiatives, Granada Hills Rawalpindi aims to be completely autonomous and sustainable cities with green energy, employment opportunities, research, development and technology and IT parks, recreation, shopping, learning for individuals and families. Along with creating jobs we are bringing you a dream living space with wide roads and infrastructure overseen by German engineers, parks designed by award winning architects, schools and hospitals of international standard and a natural water lake which enlivens the whole experience. My message to my people is that we will build a new community with houses, malls and high-rises, and bring Pakistan one of the best living experiences in the world to reside in, feel secure about and enjoy a first-world lifestyle. We aim on making it all affordable for everyone and by everyone, we mean everyone has the right to such lifestyle and it should not be limited to the privileged. Fazal Chaudhry
